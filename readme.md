>### Why?

Blade Directives are pretty useful methods for working with template views, however I often find myself needing to scroll through the Laravel [docs](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/blade#blade-directives) to find them. 

This provides an easier and quicker way to find them

>### Credits

Credits to the Collection [docs](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/collections#available-methods), this was really the inspiration for this format
